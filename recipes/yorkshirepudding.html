        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g plain flour</li>
            <li>a touch of salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>225ml of milk</li>
            <li>4 tbsp of sunflower oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220C.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl and make a well in the centre. 
                Add the eggs and a little of the milk. 
                Whisk until smooth, then gradually add the remaining milk. 
                This can be done with a wooden spoon, but is easier with an electric hand-held whisk. 
                Pour the mixture into a jug.</li>
            <li>Measure a teaspoon of oil into each hole of a 12-bun tray, 
                or a tablespoonful into each hole of a 4-hole tin, 
                or 3 tablespoons into a roasting tin. 
                Transfer to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the oil is piping hot.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove from the oven and pour the batter equally between the holes or the tin. 
                Return the batter quickly to the oven and cook for 20â€“25 minutes 
                (35 if making the Yorkshire pudding in the roasting tin), 
                or until golden-brown and well-risen. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
